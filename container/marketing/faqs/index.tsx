      question: "How does Vault続 authentication work?",
      answer:
        "Vault続 uses your Sui wallet as the sole method of authentication. There's no need for master passwords or email addresses. Simply connect your Sui wallet (like Sui Wallet or Surf) to access your vault securely.",
    },

      id: "item-2",

      question: "How secure is my data?",
      answer:
        "Your data is extremely secure. All encryption and decryption happen client-side using military-grade Seal SDK. Your vault's plaintext never leaves your device. The encrypted vault is stored on Walrus/IPFS, and the vault's content identifier (CID) can be anchored on-chain via Sui smart contract.",
    },
    {
      id: "item-3",
      icon: "cloud",
      question: "Where is my vault stored?",
      answer:
        "Your encrypted vault is stored on Walrus/IPFS, ensuring global, censorship-resistant availability. The vault's content identifier (CID) can optionally be stored on the Sui blockchain, enabling seamless cross-device recovery without traditional passwords.",
    },
    {
      id: "item-4",
      icon: "refresh-cw",
      question: "Can I update my vault?",
      answer:
        "Yes, Vault続 supports re-encryption. You can update and re-encrypt your vault when changing passwords or upgrading your wallet. The process is seamless and maintains the security of your data.",
    },
    {
      id: "item-5",
      icon: "key",
      question: "What happens if I lose my wallet?",
      answer:
        "Since Vault続 uses your Sui wallet for authentication, it's crucial to keep your wallet keys secure. We recommend using hardware wallets with Sui for enhanced key security. In the future, we plan to add social recovery integration for wallet keys.",
